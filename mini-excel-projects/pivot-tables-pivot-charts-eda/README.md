# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis using PivotTables & PivotCharts (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization** using PivotTables and PivotCharts in Microsoft Excel.

The project goal was to understand how Excel’s built-in analytical tools can be used to quickly explore datasets, identify patterns, and create effective visual summaries.

The dataset contains approximately **9,800 sales records**, making it suitable for realistic exploratory analysis without being overly complex.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis using PivotTables
- Summarize large datasets efficiently
- Create PivotCharts to visualize trends and comparisons
- Learn best practices for choosing appropriate chart types
- Understand how PivotTables and PivotCharts interact with underlying data changes

## 🧩 Dataset
- Sales dataset with ~9,801 rows
- Structured tabular data used for exploration and visualization
- Dataset is not included; screenshots of outputs are provided instead

📦 Dataset Structure & Granularity

The dataset used in this exploratory data analysis project is a transaction-level sales dataset.

Granularity
1 row = 1 customer order
Each record represents a single purchase transaction
Enables detailed analysis across customer, product, geography, and time dimensions

Understanding the data granularity ensures that aggregations and visualizations are interpreted correctly during analysis.

Dimensions (Categorical Features)
The dataset contains multiple descriptive fields used for grouping and segmentation:

Customer: Customer ID, Customer Name
Geography: City, State
Customer Segment: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office
Product: Product Name, Category, Sub-category
Time: Order Date, Ship Date
Logistics: Shipment Mode

These dimensions are used extensively in PivotTables to explore patterns and comparisons.

Measures (Numerical Features)

The dataset includes the following quantitative fields:
Sales ($) – revenue generated per order
Profit ($) – profit contribution per order
Quantity – number of units sold
Discount (%) – discount applied to the order

These measures support analysis of performance, profitability, and pricing behavior.

Why this Dataset is Suitable for EDA

Transaction-level granularity enables flexible aggregation
Balanced mix of categorical and numerical features
Large enough (~9,800 rows) to simulate real-world analysis
Well-suited for PivotTables and PivotCharts in Excel
