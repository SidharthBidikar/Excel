📊 Customer Churn Analysis using Excel (Telecom Case Study)
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses. In this project, I analyzed customer churn data for a fictitious telecom company (Databel) using Microsoft Excel.
The goal of this analysis was not only to calculate churn rates, but also to understand why customers are churning, identify key drivers of churn, and present insights through PivotTables, PivotCharts, and a dashboard.
This project was completed as part of an Excel fundamentals case study, with a focus on analytical thinking and business interpretation.
